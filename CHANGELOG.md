- More descriptive error messages for `Create` commands with a list of available options.

**Fixed**

Some typos

## Version 1.2

**NEW**

Added Laravel 11 config commands

## Version 1.1 🗂️

**NEW**

Open common Laravel folders from the command line with Open...

Nova's open quickly can be a bit quirky at times, so skip a step and directly list and open things like models and controllers by viewing those folders directly.
You can use keywords to open these directly in the command palette, but I recommend attaching some of these to keyboard shortcuts.

Currently opens:

- Controllers
- Middlewares
- Providers
- Models
- Factories
- Migrations
- Seeders

## Version 1.0
